# COMP228-food-and-drink
An app with a map simulation displaying different places to eat and drink on the University of Liverpool campus.

The app contains a map view where the user can see nearby amenities geographically, and a table view showing the nearest places in ascending order of distance. 

Users have the functionality to leave a 'like' or 'dislike' on the details page of each location, and this opinion will show on each table cell to remind users how they felt about each place.

Designed in XCode and programmed using Swift.
